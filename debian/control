Description: module to add context aware fetches to DBI
 The Perl database independent interface - DBI - does not take much
 advantage of Perl's context sensitivity. This is the situation where
 a Perl subroutine knows whether the caller wants a single scalar
 value or a list of them to be returned.
 .
 DBIx::ContextualFetch is a sub-class of DBI which redefines some of
 the various fetch methods to fix this oversight. It also adds a few
 new methods for convenience (though not necessarily efficiency). Much
 of this code was originally part of the IMA::DBI Perl module
 (libima-dbi-perl package).
